== Installation ==


1. Upload the full folder `application-maker` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (for old downloads, if downloaded from Wordpress the folder has a different name, and in some old version of the plugin it was creating a bug. If you see that all the assets, js css etc are not loaded, then rename the folder to 'application-maker' and it should work)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. IMPORTANT: you need to set the folder wp-content/uploads with a permission to upload new files there (ftp server permission 777) or else the Files feature will not work
(and eventually to create the folder manually if its NOT YET existing).
4. Eventually add the plugin 'multiple-post-thumbnails' for some specific usage needing multiple featured_images (not necessary for this CRM demo version)
